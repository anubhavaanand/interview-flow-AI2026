## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

✅ **You've Already Done:**
- Built working MVP (✓ verified running)
- Integrated AI (✓ GitHub Models configured)
- Created pitch deck (✓ 15 slides ready)
- Written all scripts (✓ both video scripts ready)
- Prepared checklist (✓ step-by-step guide)

⏳ **You Need to Do TODAY:**
- Record demo (1 hour - straightforward)
- Record pitch (1 hour - just talk to camera)
- Edit both (30 min - CapCut or similar)
- Upload (20 min - YouTube)

❌ **What CAN Go Wrong (Prevention):**
- Recording audio bad? → Use USB mic or good builtin
- Video too long? → Edit out pauses and dead air
- YouTube upload slow? → Start early, give it time
- Forgot to make repo public? → Check GitHub settings tomorrow AM
- Form submission fails? → Try different browser or mobile
- Video links break? → Test links before submitting
- Miss deadline? → Submit at 1:25 PM (4 min buffer)
