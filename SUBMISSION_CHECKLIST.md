**interview-flow-AI2026: AI-Powered DSA Interview Coach**

**Problem Statement:**
Millions of computer science students worldwide struggle with Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) interview preparation. Current solutions are either expensive ($50-500/month private coaching) or low-quality (generic problem banks without personalized feedback). Students lack access to real-time, intelligent feedback on their code.

**Solution:**
interview-flow-AI2026 is a free, AI-powered platform that provides instant, personalized feedback on coding solutions. Using advanced AI (GitHub Models/GPT-4), we analyze user code across multiple dimensions: time complexity, space complexity, edge cases, code quality, and provide 3-step improvement plans.

**MVP Features:**
- DSA problem display with detailed descriptions
- Python code editor with syntax highlighting
- Real-time AI analysis of submitted code
- Structured feedback (complexity, edge cases, quality)
- Actionable 3-step improvement plans
- Progress dashboard
- Global accessibility (no region restrictions)

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with React Router (localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Uvicorn (localhost:8000)
- **AI Integration**: GitHub Models API (GPT-4o)
- **Database**: None (MVP uses hardcoded problems)
- **Deployment**: Ready for Azure App Service

**Market Opportunity:**
- 50M+ CS students globally
- $5B+ TAM in education tech
- Growing demand for remote interview prep
- Unmet need for affordable, personalized coaching

**Business Model:**
- Free tier: Access to basic problems and feedback
- Premium tier: Advanced problems, interview prep courses
- B2B: Licensing to bootcamps and universities
- Projected Year 1 revenue: $50K-100K

**Traction:**
- MVP complete and fully functional
- Code on GitHub with full documentation
- GitHub Models integration working
- Ready for beta user testing
- Automated setup scripts for easy deployment

**Team:**
- [Your Name]: Full-stack developer, AI/ML specialist
- Skills: React, Python, FastAPI, AI prompt engineering, DevOps

**Next Steps:**
- Beta testing with 100+ students
- Add more DSA problems (trees, graphs, DP)
- Language expansion (JavaScript, Java, C++)
- Premium tier launch
- University partnerships
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)

**Why This Matters:**
We believe interview preparation should be free, personalized, and globally accessible. interview-flow-AI2026 removes barriers for talented students everywhere to prepare for top-tier tech careers.
