## SPEAKING SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi! I'm presenting interview-flow-AI2026 - an AI-powered DSA interview coach that makes coding interview prep accessible and free for everyone globally. The problem is simple: millions of students struggle with algorithm interviews, and good coaching is expensive and hard to find."

### Problem (30 seconds)
"Today, students either spend thousands on private coaches or use outdated resources. There's no real-time, personalized feedback system. No one helps them understand complexity analysis or edge cases. interview-flow-AI2026 solves this with instant AI feedback on every problem."

### Solution (30 seconds)
"Our MVP includes a clean interface where users solve real DSA problems and get detailed feedback - time complexity, space complexity, edge cases, code quality, and a 3-step improvement plan. It's powered by AI and takes just seconds to analyze code."

### Demo (1 minute)
"Let me show you quickly... [Open app] Here's our home page. I click 'Start Mock Interview' and we get a problem. I write some code, submit it, and in seconds get comprehensive feedback from our AI system. It tells me my solution is O(n) time, identifies edge cases I missed, and gives me exactly 3 steps to improve."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"We've built the MVP and it's working great. We have GitHub Models API integrated, code on GitHub, full documentation. Our next steps are beta testing, scaling to millions of students, and eventually premium features. We're asking for your feedback, potential partnerships, and support to make this global. Thank you!"
