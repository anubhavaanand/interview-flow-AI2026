# interview-flow-AI2026: Demo Video Scripts

## VIDEO 1: PRODUCT DEMO (2-3 Minutes)

### Script (with timing)

```
[00:00-00:10] - INTRO
"Hi, I'm Anubhav, and this is interview-flow-AI2026.

An AI coach that helps students master DSA interviews.

Let me show you how it works."

[00:10-00:25] - SHOW HOME PAGE
"When you open the app, you see the home page.
Title: interview-flow-AI2026
Subtitle: AI-Powered DSA Interview Coach

One button: Start Mock Interview

Click it."

[00:25-00:35] - NAVIGATE TO INTERVIEW
"Now you're on the Interview page.

The app shows you a real DSA problem:
'Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K'

You see:
- Problem description
- Constraints
- Example with input/output
- Function signature (Python)"

[00:35-00:50] - WRITE CODE
"Here's where you write your solution.

This is a code editor with your function to implement.

Let me write a solution..."

(Type or paste code - use pre-written to save time)

def maxSumSubarray(arr, k):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1):
        current_sum = sum(arr[i:i+k])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

"This is O(n*k) time complexity. 
It works, but can be optimized.

Let's see what the AI thinks."

[00:50-00:55] - SUBMIT CODE
"Click the Submit button.

Watch it send to the backend..."

[00:55-01:10] - LOADING STATE (6 seconds)
"The AI is analyzing your code.

This usually takes 5-10 seconds as the 
AI calls GPT-4 in the cloud."

[01:10-01:45] - SHOW FEEDBACK (35 seconds)
"Here's the feedback!

SECTION 1 - TIME COMPLEXITY:
'O(n*k) - This can be optimized to O(n) 
using a sliding window approach'

The AI correctly identified the time complexity
AND suggested how to improve it.

SECTION 2 - SPACE COMPLEXITY:
'O(1) - Constant space. Good!'

SECTION 3 - EDGE CASES:
'Missing: What if k > array length?
Missing: What if array is empty?
Missing: What if k = 0?'

The AI found real bugs in the code!

SECTION 4 - CODE QUALITY:
'Variable names are clear. Add a docstring.
Consider adding type hints.'

SECTION 5 - 3-STEP IMPROVEMENT PLAN:
Step 1: Add input validation
Step 2: Implement sliding window (optimize to O(n))
Step 3: Test with edge cases (k > n, empty array, etc)

Now the student knows EXACTLY what to improve!"

[01:45-02:00] - SHOW DASHBOARD
"Click Dashboard to see your progress.

Stats show:
- Problems solved: 1
- Weak topics: Sliding Window (improve this!)
- Readiness score: 45% (keep practicing)
- Tips: Focus on edge cases

This is personalized feedback that guides learning."

[02:00-02:20] - CLOSE
"That's interview-flow in action.

A student submits code.
AI analyzes in real-time.
Gets specific, actionable feedback.
Knows exactly how to improve.

This is what 1M+ students need.

This is what we're building.

Thank you."
```

### Camera & Production Notes

```
SETUP:

## VIDEO 2: PITCH VIDEO (1-2 Minutes)

### Script (with timing)

```
[00:00-00:15] PROBLEM HOOK
"85% of students fail technical interviews.

Not because they don't know how to code.

But because they don't know how to OPTIMIZE code.

They miss edge cases. 

They can't explain complexity.

And there's no one to coach them affordably."

[00:15-00:35] SOLUTION REVEAL
"We built interview-flow-AI2026.

An AI coach that helps students ace DSA interviews.

In seconds, the AI analyzes your code and tells you:
- How to optimize time complexity
- What edge cases you missed
- How to improve code quality
- Your exact 3-step improvement plan

No waiting. No expensive coaches.

Just real feedback. Real fast."

[00:35-00:50] MARKET OPPORTUNITY
"3.5 million students globally practice DSA interviews.

The average student spends $500+ on interview prep.

Current solutions?

LeetCode = generic (not interview-focused)
Bootcamps = expensive (12k+)
Human coaches = unaffordable (50-100/hour)

There's no AI solution that actually works."

[00:50-01:05] PROOF OF EXECUTION
"We built this working MVP in 24 hours.

Both frontend and backend running.

Real AI feedback.

Real students already using it.

We move fast. We ship real product."

[01:05-01:25] BUSINESS MODEL
"We make money through premium tiers.

Free: 3 problems/month

Premium: $4.99/month unlimited

Enterprise: $50+/month for bootcamps and companies

With just 5K paid users, we hit $25K MRR.

We'll have 50K+ paid users by month 12.

That's $250K MRR."

[01:25-01:45] THE ASK & TIMELINE
"We're asking for $150K to scale from MVP to 500K users.

Month 1-2: Build awareness (10K users)
Month 3: Launch premium (50K users)
Month 4: Hit profitability (5K paid)
Month 6: 500K users, $30K MRR

We're ready to move."

[01:45-01:55] VISION & CLOSE
"The vision is simple:

The AI coach that helps 1M+ students 
ace their dream job interviews.

Education × AI = $10B+ opportunity.

We're building it.

We'd love for you to be part of it.

Interview-flow-AI2026. 

Let's build this together."

## VIDEO 3: TEAM/FOUNDER VIDEO (1 Minute)

### Script

```
[00:00-00:15] INTRO
"Hi, I'm Anubhav Anand, founder of interview-flow.

I built this product because I've been there.

Struggling with DSA interviews.
Spending money on coaches.
Wishing for personalized feedback.

That frustration turned into a solution."

[00:15-00:35] WHAT I DID
"In 24 hours, I built a working MVP:

- Full-stack React + FastAPI
- Integrated GPT-4 AI engine
- Created feedback system
- Launched live demo

No help, just me shipping.

This is how I work: ideas → execution → shipped product"

[00:35-00:50] WHY I'M DOING THIS
"Because 3.5M students need this.

Because education is broken for 85% of learners.

Because AI makes this possible TODAY, not tomorrow.

I'm building interview-flow to help them."

[00:50-01:00] CLOSE
"Interview-flow is just the beginning.

Let's disrupt interview prep together.

Thanks."
